"Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination" by Matthew Kirschenbaum**This book extracts and discusses several influential positions on what constitutes "hypertext," referencing key debates among scholars like Espen Aarseth, Jay David Bolter, George Landow, and others. Kirschenbaum cites these theorists as advancing different and sometimes competing definitions and conceptualizations of hypertextÑsome emphasizing its capacity for nonlinearity and user agency, others focusing on technological mechanisms, narrativity, or textual materiality. The chapter also notes how the discourse around hypertext is shaped both by the capacities of specific software (like Storyspace) and by the ideological context of literary and media theory:> "Some of the most influential: Espen Aarseth, Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature... Jay David Bolter, Writing Space: The Computer, Hypertext, and the History of Writing... George P. Landow, Hypertext: The Convergence of Contemporary Critical Theory and Technology ... and various essays by Stuart Moulthrop... For a more recent exemplary reading, see Jill Walker's 'Piecing Together and Tearing Apart: Finding the Story in Afternoon'..."  >  > "Marie-Laure Ryan took stock of the descriptive markers that had accumulated in more than a decade of critical writing about electronic textuality. In her first columnÑprintÑRyan includes such words as 'durable,' 'linear,' 'centered,' 'tree structure,' 'unity,' 'order,' 'monologism,' 'sequentiality,' 'stolidity,' and 'static.' In her second columnÑthe virtualÑshe opposes these with 'ephemeral,' 'spatial,' 'decentered,' 'rhizome structure,' 'diversity,' 'chaos,' 'dialogism,' 'parallelism,' 'fluidity,' and 'dynamic.' ... In the end, Ryan wants to argue for textual pluralism..."---**2. "Stylistic Analysis and Authorship Studies" (from "A Companion to Digital Humanities", eds. Schreibman, Siemens, Unsworth)**This chapter discusses controversies over what to call collections of electronic resources and specifically addresses the debate over the nature and terminology of "hypertext." It points out that "hypermedia" evolved from "hypertext" but cautions against overgeneralization, arguing that not all digital works are best understood as hypertexts with nodes and links. The chapter also observes skepticism among scholars about the artistic and cultural value of hypertext, contrasting early optimism (e.g., Robert CooverÕs belief that it would cause "the end of books") with critics who dismiss it as "hype." The text ultimately highlights how terminological debates reflect deeper disagreements about narrativity, interactivity, and the cultural role of digital media:> "The names given for multimedia works emphasize different characteristics. 'Hypermedia' evolved out of 'hypertext' and emphasizes the way these works are multi-linear labyrinths of information that the user navigates. This name, however, suggests that all new media are organized as hypertexts with nodes and links, which is not the case for works like arcade games. While 'hypermedia' is a useful term for those works that make use of hypertext features, 'multimedia' emphasizes the combination of traditional media..."  >  > "A very different category is hypertext. Works of this type are generally original and not representations of previously published works. Hypertext would seem to have great potential for expression, allowing for a multiplicity of narrative choices and making the reader an active participant... While early critics such as Robert Coover believed (with some hope) that hypertext would lead to 'the end of books,' others, such as Tim Parks, dismiss the genre as 'hype.'"---**These articles together illustrate how debates about "hypertext" bridge technical, literary, and philosophical issues, questioning what hypertext is, what it is for, and what it means for narrative, scholarship, and culture.**
